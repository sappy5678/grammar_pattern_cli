# Usage
This project allows users to search verbs in two ways:
1. `find_pattern` : Find all verb patterns that matches all the entered conditions. 
    - Verb Patterns
    - Structure
    - Verb Group
2. `search_word` : Get information about a specific verb.
    - All patterns of the searched verb
    - Information about a specific verb pattern
3. Example: 
    - Take `find_pattern` function as example:
        ```
        $ python main.py
        use help for more information
        press tab for show auto complete
        > find_pattern
        please input pattern
        > V -ing
        please input structure
        > Verb with Adjunct
        please input verb group
        > ALL
        ```

        Verbs with this structure are all concerned with beggining, ending, or spending time in a particular way.
        - The soldiers reasoned that they'd prefer to die fighting rather than waiting.
        - Their boat finished up pointing the wrong way.
        - I started off doing languages, which I quite enjoyed, but I switched to law and quantified as a solicitor.
        
        Structure information
        a) The '-ing' clause is an Adjunct.
        b) This structure has no passive.
        c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb.
        
        |V -ing ||||
        |---|---|---|---|
        | die | end up | finish up | hang about |
        | hang around / round | start off | wind up ||
